{-| We're using Hindley-Milner algorithm (Algorithm W). It has essentially
three parts:

  - `assignIds`: Annotate all the subexpressions with IDs
  - `generateEquations`: Generate equations (constraints) between the IDs
    (apply type inference rules)
  - `unifyAllEquations`: Solve the equations
    (find something called "most general unifier" for a specific ID)

We also have a fourth part:

  - `substituteAllTypes`: recursively replace type variable IDs with their
    inferred types.

                   BTW GenerateEquations needed it because in case of some Exprs
                   (like List) it needed to create a new type ID on the fly.

        {- We have an interesting dilemma:

           Should we carry the substitution map around, keep the typed expr
           consisting of type variable IDs and primitive types and substitute for
           the inferred types at the last possible moment (when reporting errors)?

           Or should we substitute all possible type variable IDs before
           returning from this function, and ditch the substitution map?

           The second option seems like an unnecessary work, but for the purposes
           of readability and education we go with it.

Only goes one step, but that should be enough if we created the SubstitutionMap
correctly. (TODO check that assumption)

Remember to call itself recursively on children Exprs!
