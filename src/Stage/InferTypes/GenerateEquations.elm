module Stage.InferTypes.GenerateEquations exposing (generateEquations)

{-| Stage 2

We try to bind various subexpressions together here.
For example consider this:

    42

This is an Integer (or a `number`, we don't care here for the sake of simplicity).

    foo 42

What can we say about `foo`? It's a function from Integer (as evidenced by 42),
but we don't know to what. Right now the best we could say is `foo : Int -> a`.

    foo 42 == "abc"

Suddenly everything's clear: the whole thing is Bool because of `==`, and thanks
to the right side of `==` being a String and the two sides having to match in types,
we know `foo 42` is a String too, and thus `foo : Int -> String`.

The "two sides of `==` have to match" insight could be expressed here as something like

    equals leftType rightType

The goal of this module is to build the list of such equations for each
subexpression.

{-| The ID returned here is usually just passed over from the recursive
`generateEquations` calls. Rarely do you need to actually increment the number
yourself.

But there are such cases - see eg. List or Lambda. It is because of them that we
need to pass the ID as one of the return values.

               If we didn't increment the ID, the generated equations could
               mix up the different arguments in different lambdas. For example:

               \a b -> a + b

               would generate (among other equations) something like:
