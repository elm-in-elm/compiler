stuff to expose:

- Error
- FilePath
- FileContents
- Frontend.LocatedExpr
- Frontend.Unwrapped.Expr
- Module

- [ ] should we expose unwrap for the various exprs?
- [ ] parseProject?
- [ ] way from typed expr to canonical expr?


- [ ] TODO move stuff not used by both cli/ and library/ into cli/ (eg. desugar : Project -> ... Project, etc.)
- [ ] TODO in similar vein, don't let library/ use Boilerplate stuff - move it somewhere
