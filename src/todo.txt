- [ ] after moving of folders around stops, these should all work:
  - [ ] cli tests (end-to-end tests)
  - [x] shared tests (what we have now)
  - [x] Makefile - building and running the CLI
  - [ ] publishing the library (is there a way to only simulate this?)

- [ ] think about exposing Emit.JS, so that people can plug the library into some ports with eval() >:-)

- [ ] two READMEs - create a script (or target in `Makefile`) that will:
  1. move README.md to README-github.md
  2. move README-library.md to README.md
  3. `elm bump`
  4. `git add`, `git commit` with that README change
  5. `git tag ...`
  6. `git push` (don't forget the flags to push tags too)
  7. `elm publish`
  8. move README.md to README-library.md
  9. move README-github.md to README.md
  10. `git add`, `git commit` with that README change
  11. `git push`

- [ ] Declaration.TypeAlias - it doesn't look right, see the TODO there
- [ ] docs: links to sibling functions - use `#foo` links?
