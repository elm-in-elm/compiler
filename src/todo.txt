- [ ] after moving of folders around stops, these should all work:
  - [ ] cli tests (end-to-end tests)
  - [x] shared tests (what we have now)
  - [x] Makefile - building and running the CLI
  - [ ] publishing the library (is there a way to only simulate this?)

- [ ] think about exposing Emit.JS, so that people can plug the library into some ports with eval() >:-)

- [ ] README - create a script (or target in `Makefile`) that will:
  1. overwrite README.md with README-library.md
  2. add and commit that
  3. create a new tag
  4. do all the elm-package stuff

- [ ] Declaration.TypeAlias - it doesn't look right, see the TODO there
- [ ] docs: links to sibling functions - use `#foo` links?
