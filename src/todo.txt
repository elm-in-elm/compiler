stuff to expose:

- Error
- FilePath
- FileContents
- Frontend.LocatedExpr
- Frontend.Unwrapped.Expr
- Module

- [ ] should we expose unwrap for the various exprs?
- [ ] parseProject?
- [ ] way from typed expr to canonical expr?


- [ ] TODO move stuff not used by both cli/ and library/ into cli/ (eg. desugar : Project -> ... Project, etc.)
- [ ] TODO in similar vein, don't let library/ use Boilerplate stuff - move it somewhere



- [ ] after moving of folders around stops, these should all work:
  - [ ] cli tests (end-to-end tests)
  - [ ] shared tests (what we have now)
  - [ ] library tests (should those even exist? it's a pretty thin wrapper over the shared thing...)
  - [ ] Makefile - building and running the CLI
  - [ ] publishing the library (is there a way to only simulate this?)
